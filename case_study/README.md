# Synoptic Case Study Notebooks

This folder contains notebooks that primarily use NARR output to study synoptic meteorology events. The notebooks use widgets and should be used through the jupyter notebook enironment or jupyter lab if you have the correct extensions installed. The notebooks containing ageostrophic geopotential flux do not have widgets and use GFS data.
